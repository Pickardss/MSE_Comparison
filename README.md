# Housing Price Prediction with Boosted Machine Learning Models

This repository contains a Python script that utilizes XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost algorithms to predict housing prices. The script includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), hyperparameter tuning, model training, and evaluation.

# Housing Price Prediction with Machine Learning Models

This project demonstrates how to predict housing prices using machine learning models and Python. The goal is to create a model that can predict the price of a house based on provided features.

## Project Structure

- `Housing.csv`: Dataset containing housing features and prices.
- `MSE.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with code for data analysis, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: Brief overview of the project.

## Getting Started

1. Install the required libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost.

2. Open and run `MSE.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or a compatible environment.

## Steps in the Notebook

1. Load and Explore Data: Read the dataset and analyze its structure.
2. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, normalize features.
3. Train-Test Split: Split the data into training and testing sets.
4. Build and Tune Models: Build XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost models. Perform hyperparameter tuning.
5. Train Models: Train the models on the training data.
6. Evaluate Models: Evaluate the models' performance on the testing data using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
7. Compare Results: Visualize and compare the best and default MSE scores of each model.

## Note

- This project assumes basic familiarity with Python programming and machine learning concepts.
- It's recommended to run the code in a suitable environment with required libraries installed.
